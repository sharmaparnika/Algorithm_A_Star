# A Star Algorithm

A-Star (A*)search algorithm is an intelligent algorithm to solve a graph problem. Contrary to Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS), A* is an informed search algorithm which means that it takes into account the position/location of the goal while searching for it and hence it searches quite a few nodes to reach to the goal.
